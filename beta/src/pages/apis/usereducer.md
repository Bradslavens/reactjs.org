<Intro>

`useReducer` is a React Hook that lets you add a [reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to your component.

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init)
```

</Intro>

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Adding a reducer to a component {/*adding-a-reducer-to-a-component*/}

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage state with a [reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer).

```js [[1, 8, "state"], [2, 8, "dispatch"], [4, 8, "reducer"], [3, 8, "{ age: 42 }"]]
import { useState } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
```

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two items:

1. The <CodeStep step={1}>current state</CodeStep> of this state variable, initially set to the <CodeStep step={3}>initial state</CodeStep> you provided.
2. The <CodeStep step={2}>`dispatch` function</CodeStep> that lets you change it in response to interaction.

To update what's on the screen, call <CodeStep step={2}>`dispatch`</CodeStep> with an object representing what the user did, called an *action*:

```js [[2, 2, "dispatch"]]
function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
}
```

React will pass the current state and the action to your <CodeStep step={4}>reducer function</CodeStep>. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'incremented_age') {
    return {
      age: state.age + 1
    };
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action.');
}

export default function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' })
      }}>
        Increment age
      </button>
      <p>Hello! You are {state.age}.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

`useReducer` is very similar to [`useState`](/apis/usestate), but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component.

### Writing the reducer function {/*writing-the-reducer-function*/}

A reducer function is declared like this:

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}
```

Then you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a [`switch` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch). For each `case` in the `switch`, you need to calculate and return some next state.

```js {4-7,10-13}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        name: state.name,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      return {
        name: action.nextName,
        age: state.age
      };
    }
    default: throw Error('Unknown action.');
  }
}
```

Actions can have any shape. By convention, it's common to pass objects with a `type` property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.

```js {5,9-12}
function Form() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });
  
  function handleButtonClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  }

  function handleInputChange(e) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed_name',
      nextName: e.target.value
    });
  }
  // ...
```

The action type names are local to your component. [Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#writing-reducers-well). The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it'll be an object or an array.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        name: state.name,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      return {
        name: action.nextName,
        age: state.age
      };
    }
    default: throw Error('Unknown action.');
  }
}

const initialState = { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 };

export default function Form() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleButtonClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  }

  function handleInputChange(e) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed_name',
      nextName: e.target.value
    }); 
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={state.name}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
        Increment age
      </button>
      <p>Hello, {state.name}. You are {state.age}.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-top: 10px; }
```

### Updating objects and arrays in state {/*updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state*/}

You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so **you should *replace* it rather than *mutate* your existing objects**. For example, don't update the `state` in your reducer like this:

```js {4-5}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'changed_name': {
      // ðŸš© Don't mutate an object in state like this:
      state.name = action.nextName;
```

Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new object and returning it:

```js {4-8}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'some_action': {
      // âœ… Replace state with a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        name: action.nextName
      };
```

Read [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) to learn more.

If you prefer to write the reducer in a mutating style, you can [use Immer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#writing-concise-reducers-with-immer) to do this safely.

### Avoiding recreating the initial state {/*avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state*/}

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function createInitialState(username) {
  // ...
}

function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, createInitialState(username));
  // ...
```

Although the result of `createInitialState(username)` is only used for the initial render, you're still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it's creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useReducer` as the third argument instead:

```js {6}
function createInitialState(username) {
  // ...
}

function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);
  // ...
```

Notice that youâ€™re passing `createInitialState`, which is the *function itself*, and not `createInitialState()`, which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.

In the above example, `createInitialState` takes a `username` argument. If your initializer doesn't need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass `null` as the second argument to `useReducer`.

<Recipes titleText="The difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly" titleId="examples-initializer">

### Passing the initializer function {/*passing-the-initializer-function*/}

This example passes the initializer function, so the `createInitialState` function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.

<Sandpack>

```js App.js hidden
import TodoList from './TodoList.js';

export default function App() {
  return <TodoList username="Taylor" />;
}
```

```js TodoList.js active
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function createInitialState(username) {
  const initialTodos = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    initialTodos.push({
      id: i,
      text: username + "'s task #" + (i + 1)
    });
  }
  return {
    draft: '',
    todos: initialTodos,
  };
}

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'changed_draft': {
      return {
        draft: action.nextDraft,
        todos: state.todos,
      };
    };
    case 'added_todo': {
      return {
        draft: '',
        todos: [{
          id: state.todos.length,
          text: state.draft
        }, ...state.todos]
      }
    }
    default: throw Error('Unknown action.');
  }
}

export default function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(
    reducer,
    username,
    createInitialState
  );
  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={state.draft}
        onChange={e => {
          dispatch({
            type: 'changed_draft',
            nextDraft: e.target.value
          })
        }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({ type: 'added_todo' });
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {state.todos.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Passing the initial state directly {/*passing-the-initial-state-directly*/}

This example **does not** pass the initializer function, so the `createInitialState` function runs on every render, such as when you type into the input. There is no observable difference in behavior, but this code is less efficient.

<Sandpack>

```js App.js hidden
import TodoList from './TodoList.js';

export default function App() {
  return <TodoList username="Taylor" />;
}
```

```js TodoList.js active
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function createInitialState(username) {
  const initialTodos = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    initialTodos.push({
      id: i,
      text: username + "'s task #" + (i + 1)
    });
  }
  return {
    draft: '',
    todos: initialTodos,
  };
}

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'changed_draft': {
      return {
        draft: action.nextDraft,
        todos: state.todos,
      };
    };
    case 'added_todo': {
      return {
        draft: '',
        todos: [{
          id: state.todos.length,
          text: state.draft
        }, ...state.todos]
      }
    }
    default: throw Error('Unknown action.');
  }
}

export default function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(
    reducer,
    createInitialState(username)
  );
  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={state.draft}
        onChange={e => {
          dispatch({
            type: 'changed_draft',
            nextDraft: e.target.value
          })
        }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({ type: 'added_todo' });
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {state.todos.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
